Title reigns were determined either by professional wrestling matches with different tag teams (a duo of wrestlers) or stables (a group of more than two wrestlers) using ring names, involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or were awarded the title due to scripted circumstances; the championship could have also been vacated by the promotion.
